                <p>If you’re dreaming about your next trip to Europe, come and discover Lisbon, a historical city full of stories to tell,
                     where the sun shines 290 days a year and the temperature rarely drops below 15oC. 
                     A city where you feel safe wandering around day or night, 
                     where the cuisine is dedicated to creating over a thousand ways to cook the beloved bacalhau (salted cod),
                     and where you’ll find hotels and restaurants to suit every taste, budget and requirement. 
                     Discover Lisbon, a city full of authenticity where old customs and ancient history intermix with cultural entertainment and hi-tech innovation.
                     Lisbon is ageless, but it loves company, as you’ll find out if you meet someone and ask them to explain, with lots of gestures and repetition, where the best place is to listen to Fado. 
                     After all, Lisbon is famous for its hospitality and the family-like way it welcomes visitors.</p>

                    <img id="alfama" src="assets/images/lisbonmain.webp" alt="Alfama overhead">
                    <p>The steep streets of Alfama, one of Lisbon’s oldest areas, are lined with shops selling traditional crafts and cafes. 
                       Passengers pack the historic no. 28 tram, which winds through Alfama on its way up to 11th-century São Jorge Castle. 
                       Views from Miradouro da Graça terrace stretch over the city to the River Tagus.

                       Among the area's shaded green lawns are historic landmarks that recall Portugal’s seafaring past, like the 16th-century Tower of Belém and the sail-shaped Discoveries Monument.
                       Near the vast Gothic Jerónimos Monastery, the popular Pastéis de Belém patisserie is famed for its custard tarts
